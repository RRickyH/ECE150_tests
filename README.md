# ECE150_tests
A repository of tests for the projects assigned in the F24 ECE150 course offered by the University of Waterloo. 

## Test Guide
Download the project_i.hpp and tests_i.cpp and put them into the same directory as your project_i.cpp file. Add #include "project_i.hpp" for testing purposes into your projects file. To get an executable, run g++.exe tests_i.cpp project_i.cpp -o project_i.exe (Windows) or g++ tests_i.cpp project_i.cpp -o project_i.exe (Linux)

## How To Contribute
Make a test branch and submit a pull request. You can also send me your test cases.

*"but are we allowed to share tests?"* Yes, sharing tests is encouraged for this course and we will never be penalized for this. You may review the lecture note (21) for writing tests which is accessible on the course home page (not Learn). If you have any further concerns you may discuss this with the course instructors or myself. 

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
It is imperative that we do not share our solutions to the assignments or projects as this constitutes an **academic offence**. If you are unsure of what is considered an academic offence please seek guidance from the course instructor, an academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean.
