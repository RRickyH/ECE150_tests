# ECE150_tests
A repository of tests for the projects assigned in the F24 ECE150 course offered by the University of Waterloo. 

*"but are we allowed to share tests?"* Yes, sharing tests is encouraged for this course and we will never be penalized for this. You may review the lecture note (21) for writing tests which is accessible on the course home page (not Learn). If you have any further concerns you may discuss this with the course instructors or myself. 

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
It is imperative that we do not share our solutions to the assignments or projects as this constitutes an **academic offence**. If you are unsure of what is considered an academic offence please seek guidance from the course instructor, an academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean.

## Test Guide
This portion is under construction as I familiarize myself with C++ and testing frameworks. Your suggestions would be much appreciated.

## How To Contribute
Under Construction.
